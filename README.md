# DeepLearning_Project - Final_Version

Application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic data of patients affected by a pandemic

Motivation:

•	Ensure anonymization of patient data

•	Allow for expansion of small datasets when collecting and/or obtaining patient records is difficult

 Framework:
 
•	Adapted GAN architecture from image processing to tabular data.

•	Implemented GAN and a conditional GAN for tabular data using TensorFlow Keras.

 Result:
 
•	Determined that it is possible to generate an entirely synthetic dataset that has the same distribution as the original dataset, and which obtains similar results when used in a survival prediction model.
